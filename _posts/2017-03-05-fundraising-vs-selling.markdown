As part of my self-education efforts as a nonprofit manager, I have looked for tools and answers in for-profit books.  When looking over books about sales, I've immediately thought, "hmm... this is similar to fundraising", and then thought that I might improve the fundraising of my organization by implementing sales practices.

Today, I came across two blog posts related to the subject.
