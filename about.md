## What is the The Nonprofit MBA?
I run a nonprofit organization. In the past, I've done other types of professional work in the social sector, but I've never ran a nonprofit in the United States before.  

### Who am I?

My name is Juan Pablo Molina.  I run a nonprofit organization, just like you do.

In order to do my best work as a nonprofit Executive Director, I am committed to continuous learning. I like to research actionable and useful knowledge that I can apply on a daily basis.

I am going to collect this material, organize it and share it with you as I go. I hope this information is useful to you. 

This blog/website is for people who have a management position in a nonprofit organization.  Doesn't matter if your nonprofit is big or small, the information I will be collecting and sharing here will be (hopefully) useful to you.

## What to expect?

I intend to offer clear and applicable knowledge that should help you improve your and your nonprofit team's performance.

As I write the content for this website, I am evaluating if what I am writing passes this test:

1.  Is the concept or idea clear?  If I can explain something clearly, that means that I understand it well enough myself.  I can share it with my staff and begin implementing it at work. If I can't write about some idea clearly here, then I need to continue to work on it. 
2.  Is the concept or idea applicable? If I can't use a new idea to improve my or my team's performance, then I'm not interested in it.

If you feel that any material on this website is not clear and/or applicable, please comment or reach out to me by email.

Don't expect witty and entertaining prose.  I'm not good at that.  Actually, English is my second language.  Don't expect many long essays with my opinion about different topics either.  I do have my opinions, but it takes at least one beer (or Scotch) to get them our of me.  If you are looking for a good read of smart and witty, opinion-based prose check out [nonprofitaf.com](http://nonprofitaf.com/)  

I sincerely hope that some of this information helps you as well.  I've added a Mailchimp subscription form and a commenting system at the bottom of posts. Subscribe so I can let you know when I write something new. Use the comment section to give me feedback, ask questions, etc. I hope to hear from you.

### Why the reference to an MBA?

Personally, I'm inspired by the work of Josh Kaufman, author of The Personal MBA. A great business (for-profit) book that I frequently consult and recommend.  It would be a dream come true to see this blog eventually transform into a book as useful as the Personal MBA is, but for nonprofit entrepreneurs and professionals.  It's a long road to get there, but that is the dream. 

Because this is about access to knowledge.  What we know defines how we think, the decisions we make, how we behave, how we perform and the results we obtain.  When we acquire and implement the right knowledge, we boost our perfromance and results. So do our teams. 

Because nonprofits are businesses too. Nonprofit organizations go about their business in a different way than for-profit organizations do.  Nonprofits have goals that go beyond financial profit. Nonprofits define success differently.    

Because nonprofits aim high. We are trying to make the world a better place.

Because nonprofit work and social entrepreneurship is becoming more relevant every day. 

Because nonprofit work needs a strong supporting body of knowledge.   

Higher education institutions are slowly creating nonprofit programs to satisfy the increasing demand for formal education from individuals who want to have careers in the nonprofit world.  Just as in the for-profit business world, these new certificates and degrees aren't necessary to enter or to succeed in the nonprofit business world. 

What matters is what you know, how you think about your work, the decisions you make everyday and how you behave.  These factors will determine your success, the performance of your team, and the results that your organization achieves.
